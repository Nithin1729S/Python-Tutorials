#DataTypes
#String was one of the types of datatypes
"""String is just a string of characters.They should have quotes around them.Even a number quoted is a string"""
#You can print the characters specifically.This is called "subscripting".It all  starts with 0
print("Hello"[0])    #Prints H alone
print("Hello"[4])
print("123"+"2354")  #String Concatenation

#Integer - To declare a integer just write the number without anything else.These have no decimals
print(1_23+123)
#Note:Instead of commas in numbers use underscore to which is ignored by python.

#Float - These are capable to have decimals too
#Boolean - Has only two values True or False.No quotation marks
