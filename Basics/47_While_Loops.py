#A loop that will continuingly going untill the condition is true
"""
while something_is_true:
      Do this
      Then do this
When the condition gets false the control exits the while loop

#For loops are really great when you want to iterate over something and you need to do somthing with each thing that you aare iterating over
#For Ex:To iterate over all the elements of a list or in a particular range

#While loops are good when you dont really care what number in sequence you are in,which item you are iterating through
# in a list and you simply want to carry out some sort of functionality many many timesuntil somoe sort of condition is false
#While loop requires a kind of condition which changes its boolean value at some point of time to avoid infinite loop

#There is a danger of a while loop becomming an infinite loop ie the conditon you set never gets false
#The conditon of for and while loops have boolean outcomes
